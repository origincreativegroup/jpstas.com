  "tagline": "From 2017 to 2025, I led all visual media creation at Caribbean Pools—concepting, shooting, editing, and distributing photo, video, and digital graphics that redefined how the company presented itself. By building an in-house media ecosystem capable of handling everything from cinematic drone work to animated social content, I turned marketing into a repeatable production engine that drove engagement, sales, and brand trust.",

  "context": {
    "problem": "When I joined Caribbean Pools, marketing visuals were whatever we could grab on a phone between service calls. The work was exceptional—the visuals weren't. The company's visuals were fragmented. Each department created its own marketing content using different styles, filters, and tone. Outsourced campaigns lacked authenticity, and internal posts lacked polish. We needed a unified creative process that could scale—one that could capture real craftsmanship in the field, translate it into usable media, and distribute it across every platform without losing coherence or momentum.",
    "constraints": [
      "Fragmented visual content across departments",
      "Different styles, filters, and tones with no consistency",
      "Outsourced campaigns lacked brand authenticity",
      "Internal content lacked professional polish"
    ]
  },
  "solution": {
    "approach": "I built a media workflow that covered the full creative lifecycle—from concept to camera to campaign. Starting in 2017, I took ownership of the company's media production. I designed and implemented a system for how the brand documented, produced, and published its story. I wasn't just shooting content; I was building an internal creative pipeline.",
    "bullets": [
      "Pre-Production & Storyboarding: Before any shoot, I created lightweight storyboards and shot lists mapped to campaign goals. Whether it was a spring promotion or a highlight reel for new pool builds, every frame served a purpose.",
      "Capture & Production: Using a mix of DSLR, mirrorless, and drone equipment, I captured both planned footage and candid moments that showcased craftsmanship and emotion. FPV drones provided dynamic movement; stabilized gimbals gave cinematic polish. I also photographed products, retail displays, and staff portraits for seasonal campaigns.",
      "Post-Production & Graphics: Footage and photos flowed into a unified editing pipeline: color correction in DaVinci Resolve, compositing and motion graphics in After Effects, and still retouching in Photoshop and Lightroom. I created branded templates—lower thirds, logo animations, LUTs—that standardized our look across every video.",
      "Content Generation & Publishing: From those assets, I designed campaign-ready deliverables: short-form social videos, web hero animations, before/after carousels, printed collateral layouts, and internal training clips. Each asset was tagged, cataloged, and stored in a shared library for quick reuse by the marketing and sales teams.",
      "Social Integration & Analytics: I scheduled campaigns through Meta Business Suite and tracked performance using platform analytics. Data on engagement, retention, and shares directly influenced what we filmed next—closing the feedback loop between content and audience insight."
