  "tagline": "Over more than a decade, I guided Caribbean Pools through a complete brand evolution—modernizing its identity, creating unified design systems across print, apparel, fleet, and digital, and aligning the company's creative output with its operational growth. The brand system I built became the foundation for every visual and communication channel, scaling with the company as it grew from $7M to $17M in annual revenue.",

    "problem": "When I joined Caribbean Pools, the company had been around for decades but had never established a unified identity. Each department—service, retail, construction—had its own look. Logos varied from truck to truck, uniforms didn't match signage, and color palettes shifted depending on which vendor handled the job that week. Caribbean Pools' growth was outpacing its brand infrastructure. Without consistent guidelines, creative output was fragmented and expensive to maintain.",
    "constraints": [
      "Multiple vendors produced inconsistent materials",
      "Color and logo variations diluted recognition",
      "Employees lacked pride in branded apparel because nothing matched",
      "Marketing campaigns took longer and cost more due to redundant design work"
    ]
  },
  "solution": {
    "approach": "I approached the rebrand not as a one-time design project but as a system engineering challenge—how to make creativity scalable. This wasn't just about making things look nice—it was about creating a repeatable, documented system that anyone in the company could use to produce brand-correct materials without designer intervention.",
