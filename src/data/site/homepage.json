  "description": "From 2014 to 2025, I helped transform Caribbean Pools & Spas from a family-run service company into a modern, fully integrated brand and customer experience. Over twelve years, I built the systems—visual, digital, and operational—that connected the company's identity to its performance. I designed the brand's visual language, engineered an in-house print studio, created its digital platforms, and implemented automation systems that made the business faster and more consistent. My work spanned design, marketing, technology, and operations—bridging creative thinking with real-world execution.",
