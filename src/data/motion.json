    "problem": "I needed a single place where all of my motion output—Caribbean Pools, SaaS product explainers, kids' animation, and AI experiments—could exist as a coherent body of work. Caribbean Pools videos were created over a decade with evolving tools, cameras, workflows, and visual standards; they needed a unifying structure. My current ecosystem (MindForge, Nodeo, NexusCore, Origin Creative Group) requires motion assets that feel consistent, not like separate identities stitched together.",
