    "approach": "I approached the build like an engineering project: identify bottlenecks, design workflows, and prototype every step before scaling. I selected the HP Latex 315 for its eco-friendly inks and material flexibility, then paired it with a Graphtec cutting plotter for precision contour cuts. I designed the floor plan for efficient flow—intake → print → cure → cut → finish—with safety and ergonomics in mind. Introduced heat-transfer vinyl for uniforms and small-batch apparel runs. Designed uniform layouts for over 120 employees annually—split by department color for quick identification in the field. Trained seasonal production assistants on machine operation, finishing techniques, and design file preparation. Developed quick-reference guides so anyone could step into the workflow and produce professional-grade output. Integrated the print studio into company operations: The studio became the creative backbone of the company.",

  "reflection": {
    "learning": "Before 2017, every printed asset—truck wraps, window clings, banners, even staff uniforms—was outsourced. Each job required vendor coordination, lengthy turnarounds, and expensive minimums. Brand colors varied by supplier, lead times dragged into weeks, and seasonal promotions often missed their window. I proposed a simple idea: what if we brought printing in-house? I handled everything—research, purchasing, installation, and process design. Within months, we had converted an unused storeroom into a full-scale production space equipped with an HP Latex 315 printer, Graphtec plotter, and a dedicated apparel production station. What started as a cost-saving experiment evolved into one of the company’s most important creative investments. Over eight years, I expanded the operation into a hybrid print and fabrication studio that supported every department—marketing, retail, construction, and service.",
