  "tagline": "I led Caribbean Pools’ digital evolution—building its first e-commerce platform, ShopCaribbeanPools.com, and later redesigning CaribbeanPools.com in 2025 to unify both into a cohesive customer experience. The overhaul modernized UX, clarified the service journey, and turned the company’s websites into active revenue engines instead of static brochures.",

    "problem": "The legacy CaribbeanPools.com was showing its age. Navigation was confusing, the design wasn’t responsive, and content updates required developer intervention. The tone didn’t reflect the premium feel of our in-store experience, and the ShopCaribbeanPools site existed as a separate ecosystem—two brands that didn’t talk to each other. We needed to unify everything under one visual and functional system: a single digital identity that could educate, inspire, and transact."

      "Platform refresh: migrated both sites to a modern WordPress framework with modular block components, allowing quick page builds and future scalability.",
      "Unified UX system: merged e-commerce functionality from ShopCaribbeanPools into the main site with consistent navigation, typography, and color palette.",
      "Process-based storytelling: reorganized content around Design → Build → Maintain, visually mapping the full customer journey.",
      "E-commerce optimization: rebuilt product cards and checkout flow for mobile use, simplifying forms and improving load time by ~45%.",
      "Visual integration: pulled imagery from my drone and print studio projects—giving customers a seamless experience from ad to purchase.",
      "Team enablement: created pre-styled content blocks and trained staff to manage updates in-house, removing the dependency on external developers."

  "reflection": {
    "learning": "Back in 2019, I built ShopCaribbeanPools.com, a WooCommerce site that digitized the company’s seasonal Early-Buy Program. It replaced paper forms with a 24/7 ordering experience and handled over $100 K in sales its first year. That project proved the value of digital integration and gave us a framework for how customers wanted to interact with the brand online. By 2025, the company had outgrown that early architecture. The brand, the workflows, and the customer expectations had all evolved. The next step was to redesign CaribbeanPools.com itself—to merge the clarity and performance of the retail site with the storytelling of the parent brand. My goal was simple: make the website feel like the company we had become—modern, transparent, and genuinely helpful.",
