      "Refined the original logo into a flexible mark with multiple lockups suitable for print, embroidery, and digital use.",

      "Chose modern geometric sans-serif typography that balanced approachability and professionalism.",
      "Built a centralized asset library with templates for business cards, signage, uniforms, and vehicle wraps.",
      "Created guidelines for logo usage, spacing, and color application—simple enough for staff to follow but robust enough for vendors.",
      "Introduced digital templates for social media, ads, and web banners so seasonal marketing could be produced quickly in-house.",
      "Leveraged the in-house print studio I built to handle all large-format and apparel production internally.",
      "Designed cut files and press-ready documents optimized for the HP Latex 315 printer and Graphtec cutter.",
      "Worked cross-functionally with field and retail teams to deploy new branding assets across every location and fleet vehicle.",
      "Conducted short workshops with management and field staff to explain why consistency mattered.",
      "Produced an internal “Brand Quick Guide” summarizing usage standards and visual references."

    "learning": "When I joined Caribbean Pools, the company had been around for decades but had never established a unified identity. Each department—service, retail, construction—had its own look. Logos varied from truck to truck, uniforms didn’t match signage, and color palettes shifted depending on which vendor handled the job that week. It wasn’t a lack of care; it was a lack of system. So I built one. Starting in 2015, I began developing the Caribbean Pools Design System, a set of scalable, production-ready assets and processes that gave the company one visual language—something it had never truly had before. Over time, this system expanded into every aspect of the business. I didn’t just update logos; I engineered workflows that made brand consistency automatic. From fleet graphics to employee apparel to web design templates, every creative deliverable stemmed from a single, unified set of standards.",
