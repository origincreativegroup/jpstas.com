  "tagline": "I led Caribbean Pools' digital evolution—building its first e-commerce platform, ShopCaribbeanPools.com, and later redesigning CaribbeanPools.com in 2025 to unify both into a cohesive customer experience. The overhaul modernized UX, clarified the service journey, and turned the company's websites into active revenue engines instead of static brochures.",

    "problem": "The legacy CaribbeanPools.com was showing its age. Navigation was confusing, the design wasn't responsive, and content updates required developer intervention. The tone didn't reflect the premium feel of our in-store experience, and the ShopCaribbeanPools site existed as a separate ecosystem—two brands that didn't talk to each other. We needed to unify everything under one visual and functional system: a single digital identity that could educate, inspire, and transact.",
