The studio produced everything from fleet wraps and signage to apparel and promotional materials, saving six figures annually while giving the company full creative control over its brand.",

  "context": {
    "problem": "Before 2017, every printed asset—truck wraps, window clings, banners, even staff uniforms—was outsourced. Each job required vendor coordination, lengthy turnarounds, and expensive minimums. Brand colors varied by supplier, lead times dragged into weeks, and seasonal promotions often missed their window. The problems went far beyond cost: we couldn't prototype ideas quickly, inconsistent vendor files caused color shifts and logo distortions, long lead times delayed new branding rollouts, and we had no control over quality or scheduling.",

    ]
  },
  "solution": {
    "approach": "I approached the build like an engineering project: identify bottlenecks, design workflows, and prototype every step before scaling. I handled everything—research, purchasing, installation, and process design. Within months, we had converted an unused storeroom into a full-scale production space equipped with an HP Latex 315 printer, Graphtec plotter, and a dedicated apparel production station. Over eight years, I expanded the operation into a hybrid print and fabrication studio that supported every department—marketing, retail, construction, and service.",
