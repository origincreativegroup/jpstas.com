# John P. Stas
## Creative Technologist & Process Innovator

### Origin Story
Born in the digital age, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of creativity and technology. My journey began in the print industry, where I learned the value of precision and attention to detail. But I quickly realized that the future wasn't in traditional media—it was in the seamless integration of digital and physical experiences.

### The Workshop Years
After studying Computer Science at Indiana University, I dove headfirst into the startup world. I spent years building everything from e-commerce platforms to 3D printing workflows. Each project taught me something new about the delicate balance between user needs and technical constraints.

### The Caribbean Pools Era
In 2020, I joined Caribbean Pools as Creative Director, where I had the opportunity to transform an entire business through technology. I built an in-house print studio that reduced costs by 40% and improved delivery times by 60%. But more importantly, I learned how to lead teams and drive innovation in a traditional industry.

### The Innovation Lab
Today, I run my own creative technology consultancy, helping businesses bridge the gap between design and development. I specialize in creating systems that are both beautiful and functional, scalable and user-friendly. My work spans from web applications to hardware prototypes, always with a focus on solving real problems.

### The Philosophy
I believe that great technology should feel invisible. It should enhance human capabilities without getting in the way. That's why I spend so much time thinking about process, workflow, and user experience. The best solutions are often the simplest ones.

### The Future
I'm excited about the possibilities that AI and machine learning bring to creative work. But I also believe that human creativity will always be irreplaceable. My goal is to build tools and systems that amplify human potential, not replace it.

### The Workshop
This portfolio is my digital workshop—a place where I can experiment, iterate, and share my work. Each project tells a story of problem-solving, innovation, and growth. Welcome to the lab.
