# Caribbean Pools E-commerce Platform

## Problem
Caribbean Pools was struggling with an outdated e-commerce system that couldn't handle their growing product catalog or provide the personalized experience their customers expected. The existing platform was slow, difficult to maintain, and didn't integrate well with their print studio workflow.

## Challenge
- Migrate 10,000+ products from legacy system
- Maintain 99.9% uptime during transition
- Integrate with existing print studio workflow
- Improve conversion rates and user experience
- Train team on new system

## Solution
Built a custom e-commerce platform using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. Implemented a design system that could scale across all touchpoints, from web to print. Created automated workflows that connected the online store directly to the print studio.

## Impact
- **40% increase** in conversion rates
- **60% faster** page load times
- **70% reduction** in order processing time
- **$2M+** in additional revenue in first year
- **95% customer satisfaction** rating

## Technical Details
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: AWS, Cloudflare
- **Integrations**: Print studio workflow, inventory management
- **Performance**: Lighthouse score 95+

## Key Features
- Dynamic product configurator
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated print job generation
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Advanced search and filtering
- Customer portal with order tracking

## Lessons Learned
This project taught me the importance of understanding business processes before building technology. The most successful features weren't the flashiest onesâ€”they were the ones that solved real problems for real people.
