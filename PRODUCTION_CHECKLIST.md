## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment
```bash
# Run the production deployment script
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

### 2. Manual Verification
- [ ] Visit https://jpstas.com
- [ ] Test admin login at https://jpstas.com/admin
- [ ] Create a test project
- [ ] Upload test files
- [ ] Verify all functionality works

### 3. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor Cloudflare Pages dashboard for errors
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors
- [ ] Test on different devices/browsers
- [ ] Verify file uploads work correctly
- [ ] Test admin functionality thoroughly

## Environment Variables Required

### Cloudflare Pages Dashboard Settings
Set these in **Cloudflare Pages â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables**:

#### Production Environment
```
VITE_ADMIN_USERNAME=your_secure_username
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_cloudflare_api_token
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=fa917615d33ac203929027798644acef
```

#### KV Namespaces (Already configured)
- `CONTENT_KV`: b75bcab3b9df4e639518196d8dc0353d
- `MEDIA_KV`: 94ff64faa5bc4d45aa27bafa0c260a07

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous commit
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Cloudflare Pages**: Use the "Rollback" feature in the dashboard

3. **Database**: KV data is persistent, so no rollback needed

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
- [ ] Page load times
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Error rates in Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] File upload success rates
- [ ] Admin login success rates

### Alerts to Set Up
- [ ] High error rate alerts
- [ ] Slow response time alerts
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Storage quota warnings

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures
- âœ… Admin authentication required
- âœ… Environment variables not exposed to client
- âœ… File upload restrictions
- âœ… Input validation on forms
- âœ… No sensitive data in client-side code

### Additional Recommendations
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare security rules
- [ ] Enable DDoS protection
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Backup strategy for KV data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **File uploads not working**: Check Cloudflare API token permissions
2. **Admin login failing**: Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. **API errors**: Check Cloudflare Pages Functions logs
4. **Build failures**: Check TypeScript errors and dependencies
