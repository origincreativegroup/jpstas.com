## Content
When I joined Caribbean Pools, the company’s brand presence was inconsistent across channels. Uniforms, signage, and vehicles each used different versions of the logo and colors. Over time, I took ownership of the entire brand system, developing unified standards, templates, and production processes that gave the company a cohesive, recognizable identity.

What began as small in-house design projects turned into a multi-year initiative that touched every customer-facing experience—from fleet trucks and retail signage to digital campaigns and social media.

## Challenge
Multiple vendors produced creative materials with no unified guidelines. This led to visual inconsistency, outdated color usage, and inefficiencies across print and digital channels.

## Solution
- Designed a brand style guide, modernized logo lockups, wrapped 20+ fleet vehicles, produced uniforms, and standardized signage templates while establishing consistent tone and messaging.

## Results
- Unified brand identity across all media and locations  
- Reduced creative turnaround time by 60%  
- Saved $250K+ in outsourced design and production costs  
- Strengthened customer trust and employee pride through a cohesive brand image  

## Process
Discovery → Brand Audit → System Design → Implementation → Internal Training → Continuous Refinement
