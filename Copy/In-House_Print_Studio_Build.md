## Content
In 2017, I spearheaded the creation of an in-house print studio to bring design, printing, and production under one roof. What began with a single HP Latex printer quickly grew into a complete large-format and apparel operation.

Over eight years, I designed, printed, and installed hundreds of vehicle wraps, produced custom uniforms for over 120 employees annually, and handled all signage, banners, and promotional materials. By building templates, training staff, and refining workflow, the print studio became the creative engine for the company.

## Challenge
Outsourced vendors were expensive, slow, and inconsistent. Turnarounds for wraps, apparel, and signage often delayed campaigns and installations.

## Solution
- Implemented HP Latex 315 printer, developed production workflows, created standardized templates, designed apparel, and trained seasonal staff for print and application.

## Results
- Saved over $250K in outsourcing costs  
- Branded 100+ fleet vehicles  
- Produced 120+ uniforms per year  
- Cut turnaround time from weeks to days  

## Process
Research → Equipment Setup → Workflow Design → Production → Staff Training → Scaling
