## Content
By 2017, Caribbean Pools was buried in paper forms for service authorizations, HR packets, and daily technician reports. I designed and implemented a scalable Formstack system that replaced every major paper workflow with digital forms, integrated e-signatures, and automated routing.

## Challenge
Paper forms caused redundant data entry, delays in approval, and errors in field submissions. Peak-season hiring and service volume made manual processing unsustainable.

## Solution
- Digitized all HR, service, and customer forms in Formstack.  
- Added conditional logic and required fields to reduce errors.  
- Implemented e-signatures and mobile-first design for field techs.  
- Linked submissions directly to Jobber CRM and shared drives.  
- Created automated confirmation emails and PDF output templates.

## Results
- 80% reduction in paper use and printing costs  
- 50–70% faster approval cycles  
- 1,000+ digital submissions per season  
- Error rate in service forms reduced significantly  
- Improved visibility and searchability with centralized data
