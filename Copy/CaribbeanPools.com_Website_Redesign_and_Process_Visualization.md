## Content
As part of Caribbean Pools’ broader digital evolution, I began redesigning CaribbeanPools.com to do more than display products—it needed to **tell the company’s story**. The goal was to create a modern, responsive site that reflected Caribbean’s brand identity and clearly communicated the process of building and maintaining a pool.

The new site was structured around **transparency and storytelling**: each page walked customers through phases like consultation, design, construction, and service, supported by imagery, iconography, and brand-aligned color systems developed in-house.

## Challenge
The legacy website was outdated, inconsistent with new branding, and failed to capture the company’s craftsmanship or process clarity. Customers often didn’t understand the full service timeline, which led to confusion and redundant sales communication.

## Solution
- Designed a **responsive website architecture** showcasing each stage of the pool-building journey.  
- Created **custom process illustrations and infographics** to visualize workflow from initial design to maintenance.  
- Developed a **content strategy** aligning tone, visuals, and calls-to-action with the refreshed brand.  
- Integrated **media assets**—drone videos, photography, and testimonials—to humanize the brand story.  
- Established a **modular design system** for easy internal updates and seasonal promotions.

## Results
- Strengthened brand consistency across digital and physical channels.  
- Improved visitor engagement with clear navigation and visual storytelling.  
- Reduced sales cycle time by improving customer understanding before contact.  
- Laid the groundwork for future e-commerce and service portal integration.
