## Content
Between 2018 and 2021, I developed and led a drone media initiative focused on capturing completed pool installations from unique aerial and cinematic perspectives. Using DJI Phantom drones and custom-built FPV rigs, I produced short-form video reels and imagery that became the foundation of Caribbean Pools’ marketing visuals.

The resulting footage was reused across the company’s website, social channels, and new pool sales decks, elevating the brand and helping drive higher-value projects through storytelling.

## Challenge
Marketing relied on inconsistent job-site photos taken by staff, which lacked emotional impact and visual consistency. The company needed a way to showcase craftsmanship and create a more aspirational visual narrative.

## Solution
- Captured cinematic drone and FPV footage at project sites for promotional campaigns.  
- Built a repeatable workflow for site scouting, flight planning, and editing.  
- Edited videos with branding overlays and LUT color grading for visual consistency.  
- Produced a searchable media library for marketing and sales teams.  
- Integrated content into web banners, digital ads, and social reels.

## Results
- 400% increase in engagement on social media posts featuring drone footage.  
- Elevated brand perception and improved conversion rates for new pool sales.  
- Created reusable media library for long-term marketing.  
- Strengthened storytelling across digital campaigns.
