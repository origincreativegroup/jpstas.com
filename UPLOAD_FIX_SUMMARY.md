# Upload Functionality Fix & Global Media Management

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Critical Upload Bug âœ…
**Problem**: FileUpload component had stale closure issues
- `handleFiles` wasn't in callback dependency arrays
- Upload functionality completely broken

**Solution**:
- Moved `uploadFile` and `handleFiles` into `useCallback` with proper dependencies
- Fixed all callback dependency arrays
- Upload now works reliably

### 2. Missing Delete Implementation âœ…
**Problem**: Delete API was a stub, didn't actually delete from Cloudflare

**Solution**:
- Implemented Cloudflare Stream DELETE API call for videos
- Implemented Cloudflare Images DELETE API call for images
- Proper error handling and success responses

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Global Media Management System ðŸŽ‰

**MediaContext** (`src/context/MediaContext.tsx`)
- Global state management for all uploaded media
- CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Optimistic UI updates
- Error handling

**Media Library Page** (`src/pages/MediaLibrary.tsx`)
- Full-featured media management interface
- Grid and List view modes
- Filter by type (all/images/videos)
- Search by filename
- Bulk select and delete
- Preview modal for images and videos
- Copy URL to clipboard
- File metadata display (size, date, type)

**Media API** (`functions/api/media.ts`)
- GET `/api/media` - List all media
- POST `/api/media` - Save media metadata
- DELETE `/api/media?id={id}` - Delete media metadata
- Uses Cloudflare KV for persistence (optional)

### 2. Enhanced Upload Flow

**Before**:
1. Upload file â†’ File only exists in project
2. No way to reuse files across projects
3. No central media management

**After**:
1. Upload file â†’ Saved to Cloudflare + Media Library
2. Browse media library from `/admin/media`
3. Reuse files across multiple projects
4. Delete from centralized location

### 3. Complete Cloudflare Integration

**Uploads**:
- Videos â†’ Cloudflare Stream (HLS, adaptive bitrate)
- Images â†’ Cloudflare Images (WebP/AVIF, variants)
- Automatic optimization and CDN delivery

**Deletes**:
- Actually removes files from Cloudflare
- Cleans up metadata from KV storage
- Proper error handling

## File Changes

### Modified Files
- `src/components/FileUpload.tsx` - Fixed callbacks
- `functions/api/upload.ts` - Added delete implementation
- `src/pages/Admin.tsx` - Added Media Library link
- `src/main.tsx` - Added MediaProvider & route

### New Files
- `src/context/MediaContext.tsx` - Global media state
- `src/pages/MediaLibrary.tsx` - Media management UI
- `functions/api/media.ts` - Media CRUD endpoints

## How to Use

### Access Media Library
1. Go to `/admin` and login
2. Click "Media Library" button
3. Upload files or manage existing media

### Upload Files
1. Drag & drop files or click "Choose Files"
2. Files automatically upload to Cloudflare
3. Appear in media library immediately

### Delete Files
1. Select files (checkbox)
2. Click "Delete Selected" or individual delete button
3. Files removed from Cloudflare and library

### Use in Projects
- Files uploaded are available globally
- Can be reused across multiple projects
- Copy URL from media library to use anywhere

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
// Global media state via Context
const { media, addMedia, removeMedia, refreshMedia } = useMedia();

// Add file after upload
addMedia(uploadedFile);

// Delete file
await removeMedia(fileId);
```

### Delete API
```typescript
// Delete from Cloudflare
DELETE /api/upload?id={fileId}&type={image|video}

// Delete metadata
DELETE /api/media?id={fileId}
```

### Storage Architecture
- **Cloudflare Stream**: Video files (HLS streaming)
- **Cloudflare Images**: Image files (optimized variants)
- **Cloudflare KV**: Media metadata (optional persistence)
- **React Context**: Client-side state management

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **MediaPicker Component**: Select from library when adding to projects
2. **Metadata Editing**: Add alt text, titles, tags
3. **Usage Tracking**: Show which projects use each file
4. **Advanced Filters**: Filter by date, size, project
5. **Batch Operations**: Bulk tag, bulk move, bulk export

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Upload image â†’ appears in library
- [x] Upload video â†’ appears in library
- [x] Delete file â†’ removed from Cloudflare
- [x] Search functionality works
- [x] Filter by type works
- [x] Grid/List view toggle works
- [x] Copy URL works
- [x] Preview modal works
- [x] Bulk select/delete works

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in `.dev.vars` and Cloudflare Pages:
```bash
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=fa917615d33ac203929027798644acef
CLOUDFLARE_STREAM_TOKEN=your_token_here
CLOUDFLARE_IMAGES_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### Optional: Cloudflare KV Namespace
For production persistence, create KV namespace:
1. Go to Workers & Pages â†’ KV
2. Create namespace `MEDIA_KV`
3. Bind to Pages project in Settings â†’ Functions

## Summary

âœ… **Upload functionality completely fixed**
âœ… **Global media library implemented**
âœ… **Cloudflare delete API integrated**
âœ… **Professional media management UI**
âœ… **Ready for production use**

All uploads now work correctly and files are managed through a centralized, user-friendly interface!
