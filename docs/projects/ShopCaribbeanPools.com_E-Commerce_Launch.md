## Content
I led the design and development of ShopCaribbeanPools.com, a WordPress + WooCommerce site that digitized sales programs and improved accessibility.

The site replaced paper-based forms with a responsive, modern shopping experience, allowing customers to order 24/7 and reducing call center strain during the spring rush.

## Challenge
All sales were handled manually by phone or paper form, resulting in errors, delays, and poor data tracking.

## Solution
- Built ShopCaribbeanPools.com, digitized Early Buy program, integrated payments, developed branded templates, and designed mobile-first UX.

## Results
- Generated $100K+ in first-year revenue  
- Reduced customer call times by 30%  
- Improved brand visibility and accessibility  
- Streamlined digital campaign execution  

## Process
Discovery → UX/UI Design → Development → Integration → Testing → Launch → Optimization
