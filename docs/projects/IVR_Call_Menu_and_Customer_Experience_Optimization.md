## Content
During peak season, Caribbean Pools’ call volume overwhelmed staff. I designed and implemented a multi-level IVR system that routed calls intelligently based on customer intent, reducing dropped calls and improving satisfaction.

## Challenge
Long wait times, high call transfer rates, and inconsistent handling of inquiries led to inefficiencies and poor customer experiences.

## Solution
- Analyzed seasonal call logs and categorized top inquiry types.  
- Designed an intuitive IVR tree structure for service, retail, billing, and installations.  
- Recorded branded voice prompts using Adobe Audition for tone consistency.  
- Integrated routing with Jobber CRM and voicemail management tools.  
- Implemented after-hours and emergency routing scripts.

## Results
- Reduced average call handling time by 35%  
- Increased first-contact resolution rate by 40%  
- Decreased dropped calls by 60%  
- Improved team focus and reduced stress during peak volume
