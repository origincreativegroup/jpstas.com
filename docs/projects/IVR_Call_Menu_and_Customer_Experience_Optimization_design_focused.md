# Designing a Better Conversation: A Human-Centered IVR System

**Role:** Experience Designer · Communication Strategist · Audio Producer
**Summary:** I redesigned Caribbean Pools' Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, transforming it from a frustrating and inefficient call routing system into a clear, helpful, and human-centered communication tool. By focusing on the user experience and applying principles of communication design, I was able to create an IVR system that not only improved operational efficiency but also enhanced the customer experience and strengthened the brand's reputation for quality and service.

## The Challenge: A Frustrating and Impersonal Customer Experience

The old IVR system was a major source of frustration for customers. It was confusing, impersonal, and often led to long wait times and multiple transfers. This not only created a negative customer experience but also wasted valuable employee time and resources. The challenge was to redesign the system from the ground up, with a focus on creating a more positive and productive conversation with the customer.

## The Vision: A Clear, Helpful, and On-Brand Conversation

My vision was to create an IVR system that was not just a call routing machine, but a genuine communication tool. I wanted to create a system that was clear, helpful, and on-brand, and that would make customers feel valued and respected. The new system would be designed to anticipate customer needs and to provide them with the information they need as quickly and easily as possible.

## The Process: A Design-Led Approach to IVR

1.  **User Journey Mapping & Persona Development:** I began by mapping out the customer journey and developing a set of user personas to represent the different types of customers who call the company. This helped me to understand their needs, motivations, and frustrations.

2.  **Communication Design & Scriptwriting:** I wrote a new script for the IVR system that was clear, concise, and conversational. I used plain language and a friendly, helpful tone to create a more positive and engaging experience for the caller. I also designed a new menu structure that was more logical and intuitive.

3.  **Audio Production & Brand Voice:** I directed the recording of the new voice prompts, working with a professional voice actor to create a warm, friendly, and on-brand voice for the company. I also selected a new set of on-hold music that was more in line with the company's brand identity.

## The Result: A More Positive, Productive, and On-Brand Customer Experience

The new IVR system has been a huge success. It has not only improved the efficiency of the call center but has also had a significant positive impact on the customer experience. Customers are happier, employees are more productive, and the brand is stronger. This project is a powerful example of how design can be used to improve even the most mundane of customer interactions and to create a more positive and human-centered brand experience.
