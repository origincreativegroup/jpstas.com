## Content
DeckHand was created from my firsthand experience managing weekly and biweekly pool maintenance routes. I saw how field techs relied on paper logs and phone calls, leading to data loss and inefficiencies. DeckHand reimagined that process through an intuitive mobile interface.

The app allows technicians to input chemical readings, capture before/after photos, and automatically generate customer reports—all synced to a central dashboard.

## Challenge
The company relied on paper service logs and manual updates. Data inconsistencies led to redundant work, delayed billing, and poor communication between field and office teams.

## Solution
- Designed a mobile app prototype using React Native and Firebase.  
- Created chemical calculators and form-based task tracking.  
- Enabled offline mode with automatic sync when connected.  
- Designed admin dashboard for managers to monitor progress in real time.  
- Integrated email export and Formstack reports for customers.

## Results
- Reduced report completion time from 10 to 3 minutes per visit.  
- Improved data accuracy and eliminated lost paperwork.  
- Provided live visibility into technician routes and customer updates.  
- Prototype validated for future SaaS rollout.
