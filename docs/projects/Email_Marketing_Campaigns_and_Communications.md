## Content
I built and maintained an automated email marketing system to streamline customer communication for seasonal promotions, service updates, and internal messaging. By integrating Mailchimp with Jobber CRM and Formstack, we achieved responsive campaigns that connected design with data.

## Challenge
Customer communication was inconsistent and manual—overloading staff with repeated follow-ups and untracked responses during peak seasons.

## Solution
- Developed branded, responsive email templates for marketing and service updates.  
- Automated recurring campaigns using Mailchimp and Jobber CRM data.  
- Segmented audiences based on purchase behavior and region.  
- Scheduled seasonal reminders tied to weather and service cycles.  
- Monitored analytics to continuously refine messaging.

## Results
- 45–60% open rate and 15–30% CTR across campaigns  
- Automated over 80% of recurring communications  
- Reduced inbound support calls by proactively sharing updates  
- Strengthened brand consistency across customer touchpoints
