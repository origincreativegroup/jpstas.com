## Content
MindForge started as an internal project exploring how AI could simplify process mapping and business intelligence. The vision: let users describe a workflow in plain language and instantly generate a visual process map with optimization insights.

The platform combines conversational AI, automation logic, and data visualization to help businesses understand and refine their systems in real time.

## Challenge
Traditional process-mapping tools are complex, static, and inaccessible to non-technical users. Businesses needed an intuitive, AI-assisted way to document and improve workflows.

## Solution
- Developed prototype using React, Tailwind, and FastAPI.  
- Integrated LLMs via LM Studio for offline text-to-map generation.  
- Created dynamic SVG-based visualizations using D3.js.  
- Designed AI prompts to identify inefficiencies and automation opportunities.  
- Tested integrations with Google Sheets and custom APIs.

## Results
- Functional MVP generated process diagrams from text with 80% accuracy.  
- Established architecture for scalable AI-driven analysis.  
- Validated market potential through early user testing.  
- Created foundation for future SaaS product expansion.
